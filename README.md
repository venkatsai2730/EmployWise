Replace <your-repo-name> with the actual repository name.

Navigate to the Project Directory:



cd user-management-app
Install Dependencies: Run the following command to install all required packages:



npm install

Running the Project
Start the Development Server:


npm start
This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000/.

Building the Project for Production: To create a production build:


npm run build
The optimized build files will be generated in the build/ directory.

Deployment
You can deploy this application for free using platforms like:

Vercel
Netlify
GitHub Pages
Refer to the deployment instructions in the project documentation or ask for assistance.

Assumptions and Considerations
Authentication:

The application assumes a valid API token is received from the Reqres API and stored securely in localStorage.
API Limitations:

The Reqres API is a mock API, so it does not persist user edits or deletions. These actions are simulated in the frontend for demo purposes.
Pagination:

User data is paginated, and the application retrieves data for the current page using the page query parameter.




The UI is fully responsive and optimized for both mobile and desktop views using Tailwind CSS.
